Many of want to hack computers and networks but less than 10% of them only know what to do. So for the remaining people This blog post will give an idea about phases of hacking.

This information about this phases of hacking is taken from the book Basics of Hacking and Penetration Testing written by Patrick Engebretson.

#### 1)Information Gathering or Reconnaissance

This is a step of hacking where we collect information about our target like IP addresses, Email addresses, open ports and other.

#### 2)Scanning

This is a phase where we narrow the information gathered and try to scan the target for vulnerabilities.

#### 3)Exploitation

This part we do the relavent attack on the target using vulnerabilities found and get access to their system.

#### 4)Post Exploitation and Maintaining Access

In this last process , generally followed by black hat hackers they do make a back door and establish a port or program that will help them to directly get access to the target system another time with out any of the above steps.

#### 5)Clearing Tracks

This part black hats clear all the evidence of how they exploited the vulnerability to make sure that they won't get found.

As an Ethical Hacker we should submit a detailed report on the way we found the vulnerability to the relevant authority.
